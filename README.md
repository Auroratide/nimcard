# Nimcard

**Nimcard** is a two-player strategy game involving standard playing cards!

The rules are simple:

1. The **goal** of the game is to collect cards totalling the higher score
1. Any number of cards are arranged into rows face up so the value is showing
1. The Queen of Diamonds is always the last card on the last row
1. Players take turns taking either one card or two cards from a single row
1. The game ends once all cards have been claimed

## This Codebase

This codebases includes both the engine and a handy component for plugging this game into any website.

I will add more to this readme eventually.

## Why did you create Nimcard?

Nimcard was created for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign I DM.
